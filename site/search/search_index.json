The process involves transferring an inked image from a metal plate to a rubber blanket, and then to the printing surface.</p> <ul> <li>Resource: How Offset Printing Works - Xerox</li> </ul>"},{"location":"DOMAIN_GUIDE/#key-terminology","title":"Key Terminology","text":"<ul> <li>Plate: A thin, custom-made plate (usually aluminum) is created for each color (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Black - CMYK) to be printed. The cost of these plates is a significant one-time setup cost for each job.</li> <li>Stencil: While more common in screen printing, the concept of a stencil is analogous to the image area on an offset plate, where ink is allowed to pass through to the blanket.</li> <li>Impression: Each time a sheet of paper passes through the printing press and receives an image, it is called an impression. The cost of impressions includes machine time, labor, and ink.</li> <li>Ream: A standard package of 500 sheets of paper. Paper is one of the most significant variable costs in a print job.</li> <li>Recto/Verso: \"Recto\" refers to the front side of a sheet of paper, and \"verso\" refers to the back. Printing on both sides is called \"perfecting\" and requires a more complex printing press or a second pass.</li> <li>Binding: The process of assembling and securing the printed pages. There are numerous binding methods, each with its own cost and aesthetic implications.<ul> <li>Saddle Stitching: A simple method where folded sheets are stapled together along the spine. Ideal for booklets and magazines.</li> <li>Perfect Binding: The pages are glued together at the spine with a strong, flexible adhesive, and a cover is wrapped around them. Common for softcover books.</li> <li>Case Binding: The pages are sewn together in sections, and then glued to a hardcover. This is the most durable and expensive binding method, used for hardcover books.</li> <li>Resource: A Guide to Bookbinding - The New York Public Library</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"DOMAIN_GUIDE/#3-the-costing-process","title":"3.

The system must allow for these costs to be updated easily.</li> <li>Inflation/Deflation Adjustments: A global adjustment factor can be applied to all costs to account for economic changes, ensuring that pricing remains current and profitable.</li> </ul>"}]}
