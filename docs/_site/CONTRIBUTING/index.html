<li>Proposing new features</li>
<li>Becoming a maintainer</li>
</ul>
<h2>All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests</h2>
<p>Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>Fork the repo and create your branch from <code>develop</code>.</li>
<li>If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.</li>
<li>If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.</li>
<li>Ensure the test suite passes.</li>
<li>Make sure your code lints.</li>
<li>Issue that pull request!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License</h2>
<p>In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same <a href="LICENSE">MIT License</a> that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.</p>
<h2>Report bugs using GitHub's <a href="https://github.com/CostPress/pixelpress/issues">issues</a></h2>
<p>We use GitHub Issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!</p>
<h2>Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code</h2>
<p><strong>Great Bug Reports</strong> tend to have:</p>
<ul>
<li>A quick summary and/or background</li>
<li>Steps to reproduce
<ul>
<li>Be specific!</li>
<li>Give sample code if you can.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What you expected would happen</li>
<li>What actually happens</li>
<li>Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)</li>
</ul>
<p>People <em>love</em> thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.</p>
<h2>Use a Consistent Coding Style</h2>
<p>We use Prettier to format our code. Please run <code>npm run lint</code> before submitting your pull request to ensure your code conforms to our style.</p>
<h2>Branching Strategy</h2>
<p>We follow a branching model based on GitFlow. The main branches are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>main</code>: This branch contains production-ready code. All development should be done in separate branches.</li>
<li><code>develop</code>: This is our main development branch. All feature branches are created from <code>develop</code> and merged back into it.</li>
<li><code>feature/*</code>: These branches are used for developing new features. They are branched off of <code>develop</code> and merged back into <code>develop</code>.</li>
<li><code>hotfix/*</code>: These branches are used for making urgent fixes to the <code>main</code> branch. They are branched off of <code>main</code> and merged back into both <code>main</code> and <code>develop</code>.</li>
</ul>
